 Suicide Risk Detection using XGBoost
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a person is at risk of suicide based on the text they post online.
The model is trained on the Suicide Watch dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch/data , which contains posts collected from the SuicideWatch and depression subreddits.
